# Investigating variation in SLCT regions in _C.difficile_
Level 3 Resesarch Project investigating variation in SLCT regins of Clostridium difficile.
Using Illumina HiSeq reads from isolates across Europe (n=624). Genomic data from (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29659747/)

*Analysis pipeline:*
1. Data Preparation
2. Identifying and extracting SLCT regions
3. Characterising SLCT diversity
4. Relating SLCT types to genomic diversity
